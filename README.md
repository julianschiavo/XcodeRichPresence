# XcodeRichPresence

XcodeRichPresence is a very lightweight command line tool to show your current Xcode file and project on your Discord profile, using something called "Rich Presence".

To get started, open the Discord desktop app, then download the [pre-built script](Products/XcodeRichPresence) (or build it yourself) and run it in Terminal. You have to keep the script running to keep showing your presence.
